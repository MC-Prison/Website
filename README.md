# Website
The source code of the website lives here. The design is based off of [SpigotMC Hub](http://hub.spigotmc.org), with a few changes. That design was made by [brajo](https://github.com/brajo).

_Note: This repository may or may not be out of date!_

# Notice
Our websiet is currently offline until further notice as I'm rebranding it and I no longer want to use a fork of SpigotMC's Hub. The new website design will be done within the next 2-3 weeks incase you were wondering.
